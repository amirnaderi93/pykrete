# Changelog

All notable changes to pykrete are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and pykrete adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1]

### Added

- **Windows MSI installer** — every release now publishes a `.msi` that
  installs `pykrete` and `pykrete-lsp` and adds them to `PATH`.

### Changed

- Release builds and the Homebrew tap update are fully automated; the
  obsolete pre-multiplexer Pylance stub was removed. No checker, LSP, or
  transpiler behavior changed from 0.1.0.

## [0.1.0]

First usable release — see [docs/v0.1-spec.md](docs/v0.1-spec.md) for the
full contract.

### Added

- **Static schema checker** (`pykrete check`) for PySpark code: column-name
  typos, missing columns after rename/drop, mismatched schemas at union,
  wrong join keys, and shape mismatches at function boundaries.
- **Schemas as Python classes**, including nested `array` / `map` / `struct`
  columns, and TypeScript-style type operators (`Pick`, `Omit`, `Join`,
  `GroupBy`).
- **`DataFrame[Schema]` annotations** checked across whole transformation
  chains, inline SQL, and nested-field access.
- **Transpiler** (`pykrete transpile`) — emits plain Python; runtime cost
  is zero.
- **Language server** (`pykrete-lsp`) — diagnostics, hover, completion,
  document symbols, and go-to-definition over stdio. It multiplexes an
  embedded Python language server (basedpyright) so one server delivers
  both pykrete's schema checks and general Python features.
- **VS Code extension** wrapping `pykrete-lsp`.
- **Multi-file analysis** via imported typed declarations.
- **`pykrete.json`** project configuration with non-strict / strict modes.

# Changelog

All notable changes to pykrete are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and pykrete adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.6]

Five fixes batched from the
[pykrete-tests](https://github.com/amirnaderi93/pykrete-tests) loop —
annotating real PySpark codebases (Apache Spark + MLflow) and patching
every gap that surfaced. CI on every push and nightly is wired up there
to keep the runs green.

### Added

- **`df["X"]` subscript** recognized as a column reference alongside
  `col("X")` and `df.X`. Typo in `df["aeg"]` is now caught the same way
  `df.aeg` is. Surfaced by pilot 1 (Spark `basic.py`).
- **GroupedData shortcut aggregates** check their string column args.
  `g.max("col")` / `g.min(...)` / `g.sum(...)` / `g.mean(...)` /
  `g.avg(...)` now route through the same `resolve_path` machinery as
  pivot — dotted nested refs (`g.max("b.c")`) work too. Surfaced by
  pilot 2 (Spark `test_group.py`).
- **`intersect` / `intersectAll` / `subtract` / `exceptAll`** modeled
  as set ops alongside `union` / `unionByName`. Downstream
  `select(col("typo"))` after one of these is now checked; the
  schema-mismatch diagnostic names the actual method. Surfaced by
  pilot 3 (MLflow `test_spark_datasource_autologging.py`).
- **Chained Column-on-Column nested-field access** — `df.r.X` /
  `df["r"].X` / `df.r["X"]` / `df["r"]["X"]` — checked against the
  nested struct schema, not just the top-level column. The diagnostic
  for `df.r.typo` names schema `R`, not the outer schema. Method
  calls (`df["r"].withField(...)`) are correctly distinguished from
  field accesses so the method name isn't flagged. Surfaced by
  pilot 4 (Spark `test_column.py`).
- **Lowercase `df.groupby(...)` alias** recognized identically to
  `df.groupBy(...)`. Doc-tutorial code (e.g. `examples/.../arrow.py`)
  uses the lowercase form exclusively; typos there used to slip past.
  Surfaced by pilot 5 (Spark `arrow.py`).

### Changed

- Workspace and VS Code extension version bumps. No release-channel or
  packaging changes; the publishing pipeline from 0.1.5 ships
  unchanged.

## [0.1.5]

### Changed

- VS Code extension displayName temporarily set to
  "Pykrete — Static schema checking for Python" (library-agnostic — the
  brand stays open for pandas and polars support, planned in
  [the roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)). The change bypasses the Visual Studio
  Marketplace's post-deletion reservation on the name "Pykrete". Will be
  reverted to plain "Pykrete" once the reservation clears.

No checker, LSP, or transpiler behavior changed from 0.1.3.

## [0.1.4]

Cancelled before publishing — superseded by 0.1.5.

## [0.1.3]

### Changed

- VS Code extension republished under the **`amirnaderi`** publisher
  with the redundant `-vscode` suffix dropped from the package name.
  New IDs:
  [`amirnaderi.pykrete`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=amirnaderi.pykrete)
  on the Visual Studio Marketplace and Open VSX. The old
  `pykrete.pykrete-vscode` listings are scheduled for removal.

No checker, LSP, or transpiler behavior changed from 0.1.2.

## [0.1.2]

### Added

- **VS Code extension on two registries.** Every release publishes the
  extension to the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pykrete.pykrete-vscode)
  (VS Code) and the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/pykrete/pykrete-vscode)
  (Cursor, VSCodium, code-server, Theia). Search **pykrete** in the
  extensions panel.
- **`.vsix` attached to every release** for offline / sideload installs.
- **File icon for `.pyk` files** in the VS Code explorer.
- **Brand assets** — logo at the top of the README, file icons, and a
  proper pykrete icon in Windows' Add/Remove Programs entry for the MSI.

### Changed

- No checker, LSP, or transpiler behavior changed from 0.1.1; this
  release is brand, packaging, and distribution-channel work.

## [0.1.1]

### Added

- **Windows MSI installer** — every release now publishes a `.msi` that
  installs `pykrete` and `pykrete-lsp` and adds them to `PATH`.

### Changed

- Release builds and the Homebrew tap update are fully automated; the
  obsolete pre-multiplexer Pylance stub was removed. No checker, LSP, or
  transpiler behavior changed from 0.1.0.

## [0.1.0]

First usable release — see [docs/v0.1-spec.md](docs/v0.1-spec.md) for the
full contract.

### Added

- **Static schema checker** (`pykrete check`) for PySpark code: column-name
  typos, missing columns after rename/drop, mismatched schemas at union,
  wrong join keys, and shape mismatches at function boundaries.
- **Schemas as Python classes**, including nested `array` / `map` / `struct`
  columns, and TypeScript-style type operators (`Pick`, `Omit`, `Join`,
  `GroupBy`).
- **`DataFrame[Schema]` annotations** checked across whole transformation
  chains, inline SQL, and nested-field access.
- **Transpiler** (`pykrete transpile`) — emits plain Python; runtime cost
  is zero.
- **Language server** (`pykrete-lsp`) — diagnostics, hover, completion,
  document symbols, and go-to-definition over stdio. It multiplexes an
  embedded Python language server (basedpyright) so one server delivers
  both pykrete's schema checks and general Python features.
- **VS Code extension** wrapping `pykrete-lsp`.
- **Multi-file analysis** via imported typed declarations.
- **`pykrete.json`** project configuration with non-strict / strict modes.
